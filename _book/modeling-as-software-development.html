<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Modeling as Software Development</h1>
<p>Developing a statistical model in Stan means writing a Stan program and is thus a form of software development. Developing software is hard. Very hard. So many things can go wrong because there are so many moving parts which need to be carefully synchronized.</p>
<p>Software development practices are designed to mitigate the problems caused by the inherent complexity of writing computer programs. Unfortunately, many methodologies veer off into dogma, bean counting, or both. A couple we can recommend that provide solid, practical advice for developers are <span class="citation">Hunt and Thomas (<a href="#ref-HuntThomas:99">1999</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">McConnell (<a href="#ref-McConnell:2004">2004</a>)</span>. This section tries to summarize some of their advice.</p>
<div id="use-version-control" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Use Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control software, such as Git, should be in place before starting to code.</p>
<p>It may seem like a big investment to learn version control, but it’s well worth it to be able to type a single command to revert to a previously working version or to get the difference between the current version and an old version. It’s even better when you need to share work with others, even on a paper—work can be done independently and then automatically merged.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-it-reproducible" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Make it Reproducible</h2>
<p>Rather than entering commands on the command-line when running models (or entering commands directly into an interactive programming language like R or Python), try writing scripts to run the data through the models and produce whatever posterior analysis you need. Scripts can be written for the shell, R, or Python. Whatever language a script is in, it should be self contained and not depend on global variables having been set, other data being read in, etc. Most projects do not have long-term reproducibility needs, so be careful to choose the right tooling for the job at hand.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="scripts-are-good-documentation" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Scripts are Good Documentation</h2>
<p>It may seem like overkill if running the project is only a single line of code, but the script provides not only a way to run the code, but also a form of concrete documentation for what is being run.</p>
<div id="randomization-and-saving-seeds" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Randomization and Saving Seeds</h3>
<p>Randomness defeats reproducibility. MCMC methods are conceptually randomized. Stan’s samplers involve random initializations as well as randomization during each iteration (e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo generates a random momentum in each iteration).</p>
<p>Computers are deterministic. There is no real randomness, just pseudo-random number generators. These operate by generating a sequence of random numbers based on a “seed.” Stan (and other languages like R) can use time-based methods to generate a seed based on the time and date, or seeds can be provided to Stan (or R) in the form of integers. Stan writes out the seed used to generate the data as well as the version number of the Stan software so that results can be reproduced at a later date.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="make-it-readable" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Make it Readable</h2>
<p>Treating programs and scripts like other forms of writing for an audience provides an important perspective on how the code will be used. Not only might others want to read a program or model, the developer will want to read it later. One of the motivations of Stan’s design was to make models self-documenting in terms of variable usage (e.g., data versus parameter), types (e.g., covariance matrix vs. unconstrained matrix) and sizes.</p>
<p>A large part of readability is consistency. Particularly in naming and layout. Not only of programs themselves, but the directories and files in which they’re stored. Readability of code is not just about comments—it is also about naming and organization for readability.</p>
<p>It is surprising how often the solution to a debugging or design problem occurs when trying to explain enough about the problem to someone else to get help. This can be on a mailing list, but it works best person-to-person. Finding the solution to your own problem when explaining it to someone else happens so frequently in software development that the listener is called a “rubber ducky,” because they only have to nod along.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="explore-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Explore the Data</h2>
<p>Although this should go without saying, don’t just fit data blindly. Look at the data you actually have to understand its properties. If you’re doing a logistic regression, is it separable? If you’re building a multilevel model, do the basic outcomes vary by level? If you’re fitting a linear regression, see whether such a model makes sense by scatterplotting <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="design-top-down-code-bottom-up" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Design Top-Down, Code Bottom-Up</h2>
<p>Software projects are almost always designed top-down from one or more intended use cases. Good software coding, on the other hand, is typically done bottom-up.</p>
<p>The motivation for top-down design is obvious. The motivation for bottom-up development is that it is much easier to develop software using components that have been thoroughly tested. Although Stan has no built-in support for either modularity or testing, many of the same principles apply.</p>
<p>The way the developers of Stan themselves build models is to start as simply as possibly, then build up. This is true even if we have a complicated model in mind as the end goal, and even if we have a good idea of the model we eventually want to fit. Rather than building a hierarchical model with multiple interactions, covariance priors, or other complicated structure, start simple. Build just a simple regression with fixed (and fairly tight) priors. Then add interactions or additional levels. One at a time. Make sure that these do the right thing. Then expand.</p>
</div>
<div id="fit-simulated-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Fit Simulated Data</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to make sure your model is doing the right thing computationally is to generate simulated (i.e., “fake”) data with known parameter values, then see if the model can recover these parameters from the data. If not, there is little hope that it will do the right thing with data from the wild.</p>
<p>There are fancier ways to do this, where you can do things like run <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> tests on marginal statistics or follow the paradigm introduced in <span class="citation">Cook, Gelman, and Rubin (<a href="#ref-CookGelmanRubin:2006">2006</a>)</span>, which involves interval tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="debug-by-print" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Debug by Print</h2>
<p>Although Stan does not have a stepwise debugger or any unit testing framework in place, it does support the time-honored tradition of debug-by-printf.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Stan supports print statements with one or more string or expression arguments. Because Stan is an imperative language, variables can have different values at different points in the execution of a program. Print statements can be invaluable for debugging, especially for a language like Stan with no stepwise debugger.</p>
<p>For instance, to print the value of variables <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;y=&quot;, y, &quot; z=&quot;, z);</code></pre>
<p>This statement prints the string “y=” followed by the value of <code>y</code>, followed by the string &quot; z=&quot; (with the leading space), followed by the value of the variable <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>Each print statement is followed by a new line. The specific ASCII character(s) generated to create a new line are platform specific.</p>
<p>Arbitrary expressions can be used. For example,</p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;1+1=&quot;, 1+1);</code></pre>
<p>will print “1 + 1 = 2” followed by a new line.</p>
<p>Print statements may be used anywhere other statements may be used, but their behavior in terms of frequency depends on how often the block they are in is evaluated.</p>
</div>
<div id="comments-programming.section" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> Comments</h2>
<div id="code-never-lies" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Code Never Lies</h3>
<p>The machine does what the code says, not what the documentation says. Documentation, on the other hand, might not match the code. Code documentation easily rots as the code evolves if the documentation is not well maintained.</p>
<p>Thus it is always preferable to write readable code as opposed to documenting unreadable code. Every time you write a piece of documentation, ask yourself if there’s a way to write the code in such a way as to make the documentation unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="comment-styles-in-stan" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Comment Styles in Stan</h3>
<p>Stan supports C++-style comments with <code>//</code> for line comments and <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> as block comment wrappers. The recommended style is to use line-based comments for short comments on the code or to comment out one or more lines of code. Bracketed comments are then reserved for long documentation comments. The reason for this convention is that bracketed comments cannot be wrapped inside of bracketed comments.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-not-to-comment" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What Not to Comment</h3>
<p>When commenting code, you can usually assume that you are writing the comments for other programmers who understand the basics of the programming language in use. In other words, don’t comment the obvious. For instance, there is no need to have comments such as the following, which add nothing to the code.</p>
<pre><code>y ~ normal(0, 1);  // y has a standard normal distribution</code></pre>
<p>A Jacobian adjustment for a hand-coded transform might be worth commenting, as here:</p>
<pre><code>exp(y) ~ normal(0, 1);
// adjust for change of vars: y = log | d/dy exp(y) |
target += y;</code></pre>
<p>It’s an art form to empathize with a future code reader and decide what they will or won’t know (or remember) about statistics and Stan.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-to-comment" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What to Comment</h3>
<p>It can help to document variable declarations if variables are given generic names like <code>N</code>, <code>mu</code>, and <code>sigma</code>. For example, some data variable declarations in an item-response model might be usefully commented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>int&lt;lower=1&gt; N;   // number of observations
int&lt;lower=1&gt; I;   // number of students
int&lt;lower=1&gt; J;   // number of test questions</code></pre>
<p>The alternative is to use longer names that do not require comments.</p>
<pre><code>int&lt;lower=1&gt; N_obs;
int&lt;lower=1&gt; N_students;
int&lt;lower=1&gt; N_questions;</code></pre>
<p>Both styles are reasonable and which one to adopt is mostly a matter of taste (mostly because sometimes models come with their own naming conventions which should be followed so as not to confuse readers of the code familiar with the statistical conventions).</p>
<p>Some code authors like big blocks of comments at the top explaining the purpose of the model, who wrote it, copyright and licensing information, and so on. The following bracketed comment is an example of a conventional style for large comment blocks.</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * Item-Response Theory PL3 Model
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * Copyright: Joe Schmoe  &lt;joe@schmoe.com&gt;
 * Date:  19 September 2012
 * License: MIT License
 */
data {
  // ...</code></pre>
<p>The use of leading asterisks helps readers understand the scope of the comment. The problem with including dates or other volatile information in comments is that they can easily get out of synch with the reality of the code. A misleading comment or one that is wrong is worse than no comment at all!</p>
